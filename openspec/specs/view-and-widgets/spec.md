# view-and-widgets Specification

## Purpose
The view and its widgets show an ask's board in the user's browser: agent content rendered only as data, in a sandboxed view built from the board document, with every user action leaving as a typed message and nothing answered without an explicit act (AD-8, AD-9, AD-10).

## Requirements

### Requirement: Sandboxed view
The board page SHALL build the view's iframe from `srcdoc` through `assemble`, with exactly `sandbox="allow-scripts"`. The view SHALL have an opaque origin, hold no token and make no request (AD-8, NFR-5).

#### Scenario: The view's origin
- **WHEN** a board is open
- **THEN** `self.origin` inside the view is `"null"`, and the iframe's `sandbox` attribute is exactly `allow-scripts`

#### Scenario: The view tries to reach the network
- **WHEN** code inside the view calls `fetch` to the board's own address
- **THEN** the request fails and the session process receives nothing

### Requirement: The view's policy
The view's srcdoc SHALL carry a CSP meta tag with `default-src 'none'`, scripts and styles only by the hashes of its inlined chunks, `img-src data: blob:`, `font-src data:`, and `connect-src`, `object-src`, `frame-src`, `form-action` and `base-uri` all `'none'`, and never `'wasm-unsafe-eval'`, `'unsafe-eval'`, `'unsafe-inline'` or `'unsafe-hashes'`. Neither the view nor the board page SHALL raise a CSP violation (AD-8).

#### Scenario: A board loads in each engine
- **WHEN** a board is loaded in Chromium, Firefox and WebKit
- **THEN** no CSP violation is reported by the view, the board page or the console, a blocked `eval` that a library catches included

### Requirement: Agent content as text
Every agent string on the board (title, question text, header chip, option labels and descriptions) SHALL render as text, never as markup (AD-8, NFR-5).

#### Scenario: Markup in an option label
- **WHEN** an option's label is `<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>`
- **THEN** the board shows those characters as text, and no element is created from them

### Requirement: No browser storage
No AskBoard page SHALL use Web Storage, IndexedDB or cookies (AD-20).

#### Scenario: After answering
- **WHEN** a board has been loaded and answered
- **THEN** the board origin's Web Storage, IndexedDB and cookies are empty

### Requirement: View build and manifest
The view build SHALL publish a manifest of a shell chunk, library chunks and one chunk per catalog component, each with its SHA-256, its styles, the licence notices of the code it contains and the chunks it needs. Every chunk SHALL be a classic script; a chunk holding `import.meta` SHALL fail the build (AD-9).

#### Scenario: The manifest
- **WHEN** the view is built
- **THEN** the manifest validates against the contract's view manifest schema and lists the board page script, the shell, the Choice component and their library chunks, each with a hash that matches its content and its licence notices

#### Scenario: `import.meta` in a chunk
- **WHEN** a chunk's output holds `import.meta`
- **THEN** the build fails, naming the chunk

### Requirement: Chunk growth is stated
A chunk that grows past the size margin over the recorded sizes of the previous build SHALL fail the checks, unless the change records its new size (Consistency Conventions, Tests).

#### Scenario: A chunk doubles
- **WHEN** a build makes a chunk grow past the margin without updating the recorded sizes
- **THEN** the check fails, naming the chunk and both sizes

### Requirement: Assemble
`assemble(boardDocument, manifest)` SHALL be a pure function that returns the srcdoc with its CSP, inlining the shell, the chunks the board's items need and the library chunks those need (AD-9).

#### Scenario: Only the chunks a board needs
- **WHEN** a plain-question board document is assembled
- **THEN** the srcdoc holds the shell, the Choice chunk and their library chunks, and no other chunk

#### Scenario: Same input, same output
- **WHEN** one board document and manifest are assembled twice
- **THEN** both srcdocs are identical

### Requirement: Catalog components
Components SHALL register through one `CatalogRenderer` port, render from the board document and the draft record alone, keep no edit state of their own and send user actions only as typed view messages, which the board page validates before turning them into board-protocol commands (AD-9).

#### Scenario: A choice goes into the draft
- **WHEN** the user selects an option
- **THEN** the selection is held in the draft record and no message reaches `board-host`

### Requirement: An item that fails
Each item SHALL render inside an error boundary. An item that throws SHALL show an error state and report the error to the board page, and its question SHALL never count as visible or be answerable (AD-9, AD-10).

#### Scenario: A component throws
- **WHEN** an item's component throws while rendering
- **THEN** the rest of the board stays usable, the item shows an error, and its question offers no "Answer"

### Requirement: Question loading
A question SHALL show its loading state until all its items are ready, and SHALL count as visible only then (AD-9, SM-C2).

#### Scenario: A question becomes visible
- **WHEN** a plain question's options have rendered and laid out once
- **THEN** the loading state ends, and the question's box is unchanged 1 s later

### Requirement: Single-question board
A board SHALL show its ask as EXPERIENCE's single-question board: the tab labelled "<title> · AskBoard", a header with the title and the ask state, and one question card with its header chip, text, options with their descriptions, "Answer" and the delivery receipt. It SHALL show no outline navigator, counts, delivery switch or Submit.

#### Scenario: The plain-choice board
- **WHEN** the plain-choice ask's board opens
- **THEN** the tab reads "Which database should the order service use? · AskBoard", the header shows "Waiting", and the card shows the chip "Database" and three options, each with its description

### Requirement: Nothing chosen for the user
Options SHALL start with nothing selected. The arrow keys SHALL move focus only, Space or Enter SHALL select, and selecting SHALL only fill the draft. "Answer" SHALL stay disabled until the question has a choice (AD-10, NFR-10, FR-3).

#### Scenario: The board opens
- **WHEN** a board opens
- **THEN** no option is selected and "Answer" is disabled

#### Scenario: Moving with the arrow keys
- **WHEN** the user moves through the options with the arrow keys
- **THEN** focus moves, nothing is selected and nothing is sent

### Requirement: Answer sends at once
"Answer" SHALL send the question's answer at once, stamped with the time of the click, as on EXPERIENCE's single-question board. The question SHALL then show as answered and read-only, and the ask state as "Answered" (FR-22).

#### Scenario: The user answers
- **WHEN** the user selects "PostgreSQL" and presses "Answer"
- **THEN** one answer command reaches `board-host`, the question shows answered with its receipt at "sent", and the header shows "Answered"

### Requirement: Delivery receipt on the board
A sent answer SHALL show "sent", then "delivered to the agent" once the board is told so; never that the agent read it. An answer given while the connection is lost SHALL show "not sent yet" and SHALL be sent on reconnect (FR-22, NFR-10).

#### Scenario: The agent collects
- **WHEN** the agent collects the answer
- **THEN** its receipt changes from "sent" to "delivered to the agent"

#### Scenario: Answering while disconnected
- **WHEN** the user answers while the connection is lost and the ask is still open when it returns
- **THEN** the answer shows "not sent yet", is sent on reconnect once the board has the new connection's state, and is logged once

### Requirement: Board banners
The board page SHALL show EXPERIENCE's board banners: "Connection lost, retrying" while it reconnects, resuming if the ask is still open; Discarded, locking the board read-only; and Board moved, with "Continue here" to take the board back (AD-21, NFR-10, FR-25).

#### Scenario: The session ends
- **WHEN** the session process exits while the board is open
- **THEN** the board shows the ask as discarded, stays readable and accepts no answer

#### Scenario: The token is refused on reconnect
- **WHEN** the board reconnects and its token is refused, as after the session process restarted
- **THEN** the board shows the ask as discarded

#### Scenario: A short drop
- **WHEN** the connection drops and returns while the ask is open
- **THEN** the board shows "Connection lost, retrying", then resumes in the ask's current state

### Requirement: Keyboard core
Selecting options and pressing "Answer" SHALL work from the keyboard, with a visible focus ring. A newly opened board SHALL ignore keys until the user clicks or focuses inside it, and focus SHALL move to the banner when the ask is discarded (NFR-12).

#### Scenario: Answering with the keyboard only
- **WHEN** the user focuses the board, tabs to the options, selects one with Space and activates "Answer" with Enter
- **THEN** the answer is sent as with the mouse

### Requirement: Theme follows the system
The board SHALL follow the system's light or dark preference with DESIGN.md's tokens, the board page setting the view's `.dark` class.

#### Scenario: A dark system
- **WHEN** the system prefers a dark scheme
- **THEN** the board page and the view use DESIGN.md's dark tokens

### Requirement: Widget chunks
Each widget, a folder `packages/widgets/src/<name>/` holding an `index.tsx`, SHALL be built as a component chunk of the view's one manifest, with its hash, styles, licence notices and the chunks it needs, and SHALL register through the `CatalogRenderer` port, importing nothing else from `view` (AD-1, AD-9). `assemble` SHALL inline a widget's chunk only for a board whose items render with it.

#### Scenario: The Tree's chunk
- **WHEN** the view is built
- **THEN** the manifest lists the component chunk `tree`, registering `tree`, needing the shell and the React library chunk, with a hash that matches its content and its licence notices

#### Scenario: Only boards with a Tree load it
- **WHEN** the plain-choice board document and a board document holding a Tree are assembled
- **THEN** the first srcdoc holds no Tree chunk and the second holds it

#### Scenario: A Tree board in each engine
- **WHEN** a board holding a Tree is loaded and edited in Chromium, Firefox and WebKit
- **THEN** no CSP violation is reported by the view, its host page or the console

### Requirement: One chunk per component name
A component chunk's name SHALL be unique across the widgets and the view's catalog: a name found in both SHALL fail the build (AD-9).

#### Scenario: One name in two folders
- **WHEN** a widget folder and a catalog folder of the view share a name, each holding an `index.tsx`
- **THEN** the build fails, naming both folders

### Requirement: Widget items in a question
A question SHALL render each widget item it holds, after its options if it has any, each in the item frame and error boundary, and SHALL count as visible only when its options and every widget item are ready. A widget item whose component throws, or that no chunk registers, SHALL fail its question (AD-9, AD-10).

#### Scenario: A question holding a Tree
- **WHEN** a question with no options and one Tree item opens
- **THEN** it shows its header chip, its text and the Tree, and counts as visible once the Tree has been laid out

#### Scenario: A Tree that throws
- **WHEN** the Tree's component throws while rendering
- **THEN** the item shows an error, its question offers no "Answer", and the rest of the board stays usable

### Requirement: Widget edits only fill the draft
Every edit to a widget SHALL go into the draft record and SHALL send nothing. A widget whose edits bring it back to the agent's content SHALL hold no draft value (AD-9, AD-10, AD-20).

#### Scenario: Editing without answering
- **WHEN** the user renames, adds, deletes and moves nodes and edits fields
- **THEN** no view message other than the question's `ready` leaves the view

#### Scenario: Edits undone by hand
- **WHEN** the user renames a node and then renames it back to its first name
- **THEN** the Tree holds no draft value and "Answer" is disabled again

### Requirement: Answering a question with a widget
"Answer" SHALL be enabled once the question has a choice or a widget holds a change. It SHALL send one answer message carrying the chosen options, if any, and the full edited value of each changed widget item in its input-format shape, and nothing for an untouched one. The question SHALL then be read-only (AD-10, AD-20, FR-22).

#### Scenario: The UJ-2 edits by keyboard
- **WHEN** the user makes the approved UJ-2 answer's `wbs` edits with the keyboard and presses "Answer"
- **THEN** one answer message leaves the view, its Tree value validates as an edited value, and the contract's diff of the sent and the edited value equals the approved `wbs` operations

#### Scenario: Nothing changed
- **WHEN** a Tree question opens and the user only moves the focus and expands and collapses nodes
- **THEN** "Answer" stays disabled

### Requirement: The board page refuses widget answers for now
Until the board protocol carries a widget's value, the board page SHALL refuse an answer message that carries one, send nothing to `board-host` and leave the question open, and its validators SHALL refuse a board document whose question holds widget items (AD-10, NFR-10).

#### Scenario: An answer with a Tree value
- **WHEN** the view sends an answer that carries a Tree's value
- **THEN** the board page replies that it refused it, and no answer command reaches `board-host`

#### Scenario: A board document holding a Tree
- **WHEN** `board-host`'s board message carries a question with a Tree item
- **THEN** the board page refuses the message as outside the schema and never builds the view from it

### Requirement: Tree layout
The Tree SHALL show its nodes as a treegrid in the widget frame: a toolbar, a header row of column names, and one row per visible node, indented per level, with a chevron on a node that has children, the node's name, and its fields as columns, numbers right-aligned. Every agent string SHALL render as text (AD-8, DESIGN.md Widgets, Tree; EXPERIENCE Widgets, Tree).

#### Scenario: The fixture Tree opens
- **WHEN** the fixture Tree question opens
- **THEN** the Tree shows the column names, and the eight nodes fully expanded, `Design` and `Build` with an open chevron and their children indented one level

#### Scenario: Markup in agent strings
- **WHEN** a node's name, a column's label and a text field hold `<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>`
- **THEN** the Tree shows those characters as text, and no element is created from them

### Requirement: Tree expand and collapse
A node with children SHALL expand and collapse from its chevron and from the keyboard. A standalone Tree SHALL open fully expanded. Expanding and collapsing SHALL change no value and SHALL NOT count as a change (EXPERIENCE open item 24, proposal open question 8).

#### Scenario: Collapsing a branch
- **WHEN** the user collapses `Build`
- **THEN** its three children are hidden, its chevron points right, and "Answer" stays disabled

### Requirement: Tree editing
The user SHALL rename a node and edit its fields in place: Enter or F2 starts editing the focused name or field, Enter or leaving the field commits, Escape restores the previous value. A number field SHALL be a text input read by AskBoard's own en-US parser, echoing the parsed value and refusing an ambiguous entry with a message, and an empty name SHALL NOT be committed.

#### Scenario: Editing a number
- **WHEN** the user types `1,234.5` in a number field and presses Enter
- **THEN** the field holds 1234.5 and the draft holds the change

#### Scenario: An ambiguous number
- **WHEN** the user types `1,5` in a number field and presses Enter
- **THEN** the field shows a message, keeps the focus, and the draft is unchanged

#### Scenario: Escape
- **WHEN** the user edits a name and presses Escape
- **THEN** the name is as before and the draft is unchanged

### Requirement: Tree adding nodes
"Add node" SHALL insert a node right after the current one and "Add child" a last child of the current one, which expands. A new node SHALL start editing its empty name, and an empty commit or Escape SHALL take it away again. A node the user adds SHALL get the ID `u-<n>`, `n` one more than the highest such number in the item (AD-7, F10, AD-10).

#### Scenario: Adding a sibling
- **WHEN** the user focuses `portal`, chooses "Add node" and types `Customer portal: dashboards`
- **THEN** a node `u-1` with that name follows `portal` under `build`, and focus is on it

#### Scenario: A node left without a name
- **WHEN** the user chooses "Add child" and presses Escape
- **THEN** no node is added and the draft is unchanged

### Requirement: Tree deleting nodes
Deleting SHALL remove the current node with its descendants. A node with children SHALL be deleted only after an inline confirmation that says how many nodes go with it, with the focus on "Cancel". After a delete, focus SHALL move to the next sibling, else the previous one, else the parent (EXPERIENCE Widgets, Tree).

#### Scenario: Deleting a leaf
- **WHEN** the user presses Delete on `reporting`
- **THEN** `reporting` is gone and focus is on `billing`

#### Scenario: Deleting a branch
- **WHEN** the user presses Delete on `design`, which has three children
- **THEN** a confirmation says that `Design` and the 3 nodes under it will be deleted, focus is on "Cancel", and nothing is deleted until the user confirms

### Requirement: Tree moving nodes
The moves SHALL be up, down, indent and outdent, each carrying the node's subtree: up and down swap the node with its neighbouring sibling; indent makes it the last child of its previous sibling; outdent places it right after its parent. A move that is not possible SHALL be disabled, and focus SHALL follow the moved node (EXPERIENCE Widgets, Tree; proposal open question 13).

#### Scenario: Indenting
- **WHEN** the user indents `billing`, which follows `portal`
- **THEN** `billing` becomes the last child of `portal`, and `portal` is expanded

#### Scenario: Outdenting
- **WHEN** the user outdents `portal`, the first of `build`'s three children
- **THEN** `portal` follows `build` at the top level, and `billing` and `reporting` stay under `build`

#### Scenario: At the edges
- **WHEN** the focus is on the first child of a node, or on a top-level node
- **THEN** "Move up" and "Indent" are disabled on the first, "Outdent" on the second, and their keys change nothing

### Requirement: Tree keyboard
The toolbar and the tree SHALL each be one Tab stop. In the tree, the arrow keys, Home and End SHALL move the focus as in a treegrid; Alt+Shift with ArrowUp, ArrowDown, ArrowRight and ArrowLeft SHALL move up, move down, indent and outdent; Delete or Backspace SHALL delete. These keys SHALL trigger no browser action, and every toolbar tool SHALL work from the keyboard with a visible focus ring (NFR-12).

#### Scenario: Moving with the keyboard only
- **WHEN** the user tabs into the tree, moves to `billing` with the arrow keys and presses Alt+Shift+ArrowUp
- **THEN** `billing` precedes `portal`, focus stays on `billing`, and the page has not navigated

#### Scenario: Adding from the toolbar by keyboard
- **WHEN** the user tabs to the toolbar, moves to "Add node" with the arrow keys and presses Enter
- **THEN** a new node after the current one starts editing its name

### Requirement: Tree change highlight
The Tree SHALL show what the user changed against what the agent sent: changed names and fields in the change hue with its border, an added row with the change bar, a moved row with a change mark on its name. The toolbar SHALL read "Changes vs agent's original · none yet" until the first change, then "Your changes: N", counting each added, removed, moved or edited node once (FR-11; EXPERIENCE Change highlight, By surface).

#### Scenario: Counting changes
- **WHEN** the user renames `portal`, adds `u-1` and deletes `reporting`
- **THEN** the renamed name and the added row carry the change highlight and the toolbar reads "Your changes: 3"

### Requirement: Tree plain values
The Tree SHALL show and edit node fields as plain values and SHALL compute none: no roll-up, total or formula, and its answer SHALL carry no derived value (AD-13; proposal open question 3).

#### Scenario: A child's estimate changes
- **WHEN** the user changes a number field of `portal`
- **THEN** no field of `build` or of any other node changes

### Requirement: Read-only Tree
When its question is answered, being sent or locked, the Tree SHALL stay readable and navigable, expanding and collapsing included, and SHALL accept no edit: editing keys do nothing and every toolbar tool is disabled (AD-10, AD-21).

#### Scenario: After "Answer"
- **WHEN** the user has pressed "Answer" on a Tree question
- **THEN** the Tree shows the sent value, Enter and the move keys change nothing, and every toolbar tool is disabled

### Requirement: Tree limits on the board
"Add node" and "Add child" SHALL be disabled when the Tree holds 500 nodes, and "Indent" and "Add child" when the result would sit deeper than 8 levels, so an edited value never breaks the contract's limits.

#### Scenario: At the node limit
- **WHEN** a Tree holds 500 nodes
- **THEN** "Add node" and "Add child" are disabled
